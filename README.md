# Random Password Generator

## Description
This is a project that allowed me to take the HTML and CSS starter code that was given to me and write/apply my own javascript code to make a random password generator. This website allows the user to be able to generate a randomized password through a series of prompts. The password generator gives the user the capability to dictate the password length between 8 and 128 characters, allowed the user to dictate if they wanted to include uppercase, lowercase, numerial, and/or special characters in their random password.

I learned a lot about the fundamentals of javascript and how it's applied to a website. I learned to use javascript to validate the user's selection. Also learned how to debug an error using the console in Chrome DevTools.

## Installation
1. Write/review Javascript code then preview and test generator.
2. Push code to repo stored in Github.
3. Check to make sure website went live on Github.
